# 🎓 Cognitive-Aware Website Redesign – Civilicanew

## 📘 About the Project

This project is a **redesigned web interface** of the _Civilica_ website, developed as part of my Master’s thesis in **Cognitive Science**.  
The purpose of this redesign is to create a **cognitively optimized digital interface** tailored for individuals experiencing **attention deficits** and **working memory impairments**.

By integrating cognitive design principles and usability heuristics, the new interface improves accessibility, clarity, and user flow — especially for users who may find traditional website layouts cognitively overwhelming.

> 🔬 **Thesis Title:**  
> _Designing Optimal Digital Interfaces for Websites for Individuals with Impaired Attention and Working Memory, and Its Initial Validation_
